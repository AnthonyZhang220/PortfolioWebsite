#About me section

Hello, I'm Anthony Zhang; a motivated self-taught Front End Enigneer based in New York City. I've spent the last 2 years learning, building and developing websites from achieving small functionalities by simply displaying information and content, to large commercial scaled project, dealing with complex state management and data manipulations.

Rather than having an education in Computer Science, without knowing where my passion was when I was still 18, I decided to pursue a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from New York University. After spending 3 years grasping the knowledge of economics in college, I found myself not so sure of the path I am taking. I've always wanting to build things. Since the knowledge and the learning process in mathematic can be easliy transferred to science and enigneering, I quickly pick up the basics of front end development.
